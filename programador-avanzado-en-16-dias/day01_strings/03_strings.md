# Strings

Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks:

`print("hello guys")`

You also can write "\" and then put quotation marks:
`print("Hello world, my name is \"Jorge\"")`

"\n" is for making a like break.
`print('This is my first line\nThis is my second line')`

"\t" is an escape sequence that represents a tab character. When is used within a string, it inserts a horizontal tab at that position:
`print('Hello\tWorkd')`

To assign a string to a variable:
`a = "Hello"`

You can also assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:

```
a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consctetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt""""
```
